# Markdown Style Guide

The rules below are intended to act as a guideline for writing documentation for
the Rhombus platform. This is a working document.

# Resources

This documentation is generated by [Slate](https://github.com/lord/slate).

Slate utilizes [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
syntax.

For guidance on writing good documentation:

- [Documentation Principles](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/writing/docs-principles/) by Write The Docs
- [Great Documentation](https://jacobian.org/writing/great-documentation/) by
  Jacob Kaplan Moss

# Getting Started

Read the README at the root of this repo for basic information on getting
started with and deploying documentation via
[Slate](https://github.com/lord/slate) with [GitHub
Pages](https://pages.github.com).

The documentation for this project lives entirely inside of `source/index.html.md`.

## Headers and Hierarchy

- Avoid using headers with a "index" of `3` or higher (i.e. `### header` or
  `h3`).

- Precedence between hierarchical relationships in sections is represented by
  the "index" of the header. For example, an `h2` header is assumed to the
  parent of subsequent `h3` headers.

## Content

- Sections should begin with a paragraph description of its subject matter.

- Section content should be supplemented by asides and code examples.

- Avoid Line length in excess of 80 characters.

# Asides

## Generic Aside

Asides are used to highlight information. They are written in standard HTML
markup. An aside uses an `h3` for the title, and a `p` tag for the content.

<aside>
<h3>
  This is standard aside.
</h3>

<p>
This text explains something.
</p>

</aside>

## Example Aside

"Example" asides are used to verbally highlight an example of a situation that
can be used to effectively highlight a type of usage.

<aside class="example">
<span class="aside-type">Example</span>
<h3>
  Title
</h3>

<p>
  Description here how the example applies to the principle being described.
</p>

</aside>

## Notice Aside

"Notice" asides are used to highlight edge cases or "gotchas" that may be common
errors, or may not be self-evident.

<aside class="notice">
  Don't forget to use notice asides.
</aside>

# Code Examples

```csharp
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;
```

Code examples should be placed at the top of a section, before any paragraph or
other text.
